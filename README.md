# Planetary Processing Defold SDK

To install, add `https://github.com/Planetary-Processing/defold-sdk/archive/master.zip` as a dependency in your `game.project` file.

You will also need to add the [Defold Protobuf](https://github.com/Melsoft-Games/defold-protobuf) library by adding the dependency `https://github.com/Melsoft-Games/defold-protobuf/archive/master.zip` in the same way.

And the [Defold Websocket](https://github.com/defold/extension-websocket) library, by adding the dependency `https://github.com/defold/extension-websocket/archive/master.zip`.

The included example project also uses [Defold Orthographic](https://github.com/britzl/defold-orthographic/) as a dependency.
